In this project, we investigated why citizen science is such a powerful tool for monitoring periodical cicadas. We used cartographic visualization to examine the aspects of periodical cicadas that make them such a good match for the interests and abilities of the non-expert public, including the unique life cycles of cicadas, their widespread yet sporadic distribution across time and space, and the striking and sensory nature of cicada emergences to the humans who experience them.



### Cicada life cycle experience
