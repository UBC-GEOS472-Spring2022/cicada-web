      description:"The robust historical record of cicada monitoring by non-expert citizens enables predictions about when and where cicadas will emerge across the country in any given year. From the beginning, this historical record has relied on crowdsourced data, even before it was recognized as “citizen science.” The first set of maps of periodical cicada brood emergence was compiled in 1898 by Christopher Marlatt based on reports collected from weather reporters, postmasters, and both amateur and professional entomologists (Cooley et al., 2015). These maps were updated by Marlatt in 1907 and by Simon et al. in 1988 using more crowdsourced data, forming the basis for the county-level predictions seen here (Liebhold et al., 2013).",

      description: "Each emergence is a synchronized group of cicadas that reaches adulthood at the same time, and emergences are classed into broods based on the year in which they reach adulthood and their life cycle length (Koenig & Liebhold, 2013). Broods up to XVII live for 17 years, while broods XVIII and above live for 13 years (Cooley, n.d.) The density of cicadas in an emergence has been estimated at between 8,355 and 3,700,000 insects per hectare (Marshall, 2001). The chorus of thousands of cicadas calling simultaneously is an obvious auditory phenomenon for humans living nearby. Yet the counties where one can hear periodical cicadas change significantly from year to year.",

Compare this to the map below, an early map of Brood II emergences published by Marlatt in 1898. Little has changed in our predictions for periodical cicada emergences in over a century of monitoring, but only time will tell whether cicadas remain so reliable in the future.",
